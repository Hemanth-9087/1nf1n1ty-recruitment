owned by user bandit7

1.find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null

given that, the files is somewhere in the server. 
find / means start searching from the roor folder 
for a file which is owned by the user bandit7 and :: -user bandit7
owned by the group bandit7 :: -group bandit6
and whose size is 33 bytes   :: -size 33c
if we dont have persmissions to view a folder or file we get an error
